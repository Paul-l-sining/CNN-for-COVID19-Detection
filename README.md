# CNN-for-COVID19-Detection

## Final Project of "Introduction to Deep Learning" 

A Flask based Web Application that helps a patient to detect whether he/she has got a COVID-19 or not by asking him/her to upload a lung's CT scan. 

Project in detailed:  

  1. When the user go to the web main page, he needs to log in first before using the functionality by entering their USERNAME and EMAIL
  
  2. After logging in, the user is able to chat with his/her personal assistant (Doc Bot) built in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or ask the infomation about COVID
  
  3. Next, the user is also able to go to "Diagonsis" page to upload their lung's CT Scan, Doc Bot will use Convolutional Nerual Network (CNN) to detect if he/she has got COVID
  
  4. When Doc Bot has generate the result, the user will be given a pdf file about the diagonsis report. 
  
  5. If the user go back to the user page, now he/she will be able to claim a "Things you need to know about COVID-19" report, which will be sent to his/her email.
